# Cash Sweep Checking Account Add-On, Bank of America

## Summary
Helps us invest the money in our Bank of America checking account. Sends us email notifications daily when our checking account balance is too low or too high. Graphs out our checking account balance, so we can fine-tune our automatic investments. Generates about $300/year in financial value. It's easier to do with Wells Fargo than Bank of America.

## Reliability
I've been running this since May 2024, and it works well. It has error handling too.

## Implementation
Google Apps Script. Reach out to Scott for more details - srburnett111@gmail.com
