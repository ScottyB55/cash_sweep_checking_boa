# Cash Sweep Checking Account Plugin, Bank of America

## Summary
Helps us invest the money in our Bank of America checking account. Sends us email notifications daily when our checking account balance is too low or too high. [Graphs out our checking account balance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4Cjd7HYVJiZ_eHjveifmQ58KP4y4dcOke4ffJzniMU/edit?usp=sharing), so we can [fine-tune our automatic investments](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4Cjd7HYVJiZ_eHjveifmQ58KP4y4dcOke4ffJzniMU/edit#gid=1885744358). Generates about $300/year in financial value. It's easier to do with Wells Fargo than Bank of America.

## Reliability
I've been running this since May 2024, and it works well. It has error handling too. Note: my Bank of America direct deposits stopped for a few weeks starting Mid-November 2024, so I could take advantage of a Citadel checkinga account promotion.

## Implementation
Google Apps Script. It's straightforward to set up and run automatically daily. Reach out to Scott for more details - srburnett111@gmail.com
